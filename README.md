Smart Agriculture system based on IoT

The project proposes to create a novel smart IOT based agriculture system which will assist farmers in getting live data (Temperature, soil moisture, humidity) for efficient environment monitoring which will enable them to do smart farming and increase their overall yield and quality of products.

This intends to provide farmers with a mobile/web app using which they can monitor the temperature, humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details. Based on all the parameters the farmer can water his crop by controlling the motors using the web application. Even if the farmer is not present near his crop he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application from anywhere.
